# ECS 188 Writing Assignment 2: Annotated Bibliography & Thesis Draft

## Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to help you prepare source material for your final writing project. 

## Annotated Bibliography

### Purpose
An annotated bibliography is a list of sources, each accompanied by a brief descriptive and evaluative paragraph. This tool helps you organize and analyze your research, providing a foundation for your final paper. It allows you to critically engage with your sources and synthesize information before you begin writing.

### Instructions
Include at at minimum **5 annotated sources**. Each annotation should be **300-500 words**.

At a high level, the annotation for each source should contain notes that will be useful to you when you start drafting your paper.

Each annotation should include:

+ **Bibliographic information** for the source
  - You don't need to use a specific citation style. Include enough information that you or someone else could easily find the source by searching the internet. Include at a minimum the following information:
    - Author(s)
    - Title
    - Publication date
+ A **summary** of the source
+ A description of the source's **relevance to your topic**
+ A description of the source's **strengths and weaknesses**

Additionally, you might include:

- How the source relates to other sources you have read
- How the source relates to other topics from the class
- Whatever other notes or observations might be useful to you when you start drafting your paper

Each annotation should be in **paragraph form**. This is not a strict requirement of annotated bibliographies in general (I often use a combination of full paragraphs and bullet points), but it is a requirement for this assignment, mostly to make your submission legible to others.

### Submission

Include your references in BibTeX format by editing `refs.bib`.
Include your annotated bibliography in markdown format by editing `bibliography.md`.
